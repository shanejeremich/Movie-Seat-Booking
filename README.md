# Movie Seat Booking

You can find the deployed project at [Movie Seat Booking](https://shanejeremich.github.io/Movie-Seat-Booking/)

## Overview

This project is a sample of booking your seats at a Movie theater. You pick a movie, all have different dollar values, and then you pick where you want to sit and the number of seats you'd like. The totals will update on the last line. Data will persist through Local Storage.
